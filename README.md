# MacinSoft software

At the end of the 90s I obtained a Macintosh PowerPC and started programming software for it using REALBasic.  
I published these tools under the name MacinSoft and actually made a few bucks by selling $5 licenses. 
Having forgot all about it 20+ years laters, I was reminded of this operation by someone who is still using one of the tools (BlueHTTP) to this date.  

Because appearantly some of these tools are still useful for use on ancient Macs, I decided to find everything that still remains and release it here, free for everyone to do whatever they want with it.  
Unfortunately the source code and license keys are all lost (with the exception of one license key, for BlueHTTP), but I did manage to retrieve the [binaries](https://github.com/DotTech/MacinSoft/blob/main/software) from archive.org as well as the [website](https://github.com/DotTech/MacinSoft/blob/main/website) I ran back then.

If you are really keen on using one of the tools and need the license key for it: each tool has just one license key which is hard-coded unencrypted into the binary.  
You will need to know your way around a classic Mac res/hex editor, but with that you should be able to find the key in there somewhere.  

## BlueHTTP

[BlueHTTP](https://github.com/DotTech/MacinSoft/raw/main/software/BlueHTTP_1.0_68k.sit) is most likely the only useful tool in this entire repository.  
It's an 68K application (so it runs on both 68K and PPC macs) that allows you to point to a URL and download its contents as a file.  
It also support pausing and resuming the download, which was not supported by any of the browsers of that era.

Thanks to a 20-year old crack list, the BlueHTTP license key was recovered. 
Register the application with license key **MSBH100-1250-5254-145706** to remove the 5 minute time limit on its usage.
